Connect [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) to the Chrome or Firefox tab you are already using. The model can read page content, click controls, fill forms, scroll, and navigate while preserving your login state, session, and cookies. A side panel or sidebar provides the conversation UI.

`dsh` is DeepSeek AI's open-source, plugin-based agent harness. This repository provides a companion browser bridge plugin and Chrome/Firefox MV3 extension as one standalone pnpm workspace.

Browser operation remains text-only: pages become structured text with a numbered inventory of interactive elements, and the model addresses those elements by number. dsh 0.1.1 multimodal chat is separate from that page channel—the side panel accepts PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF attachments when the host advertises image support, while browser tools still never capture screenshots.

## Quick install

The standard `dsh plugin` command alone cannot install this project. The integration contains both a dsh bridge plugin and a browser extension. The one-line installer currently sets up the Chrome build.

macOS and Linux:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lum1104/dsh-browser/refs/heads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Windows, in PowerShell:

```powershell
$s="$env:TEMP\dsh-install.ps1"; irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lum1104/dsh-browser/refs/heads/main/scripts/install.ps1 -OutFile $s; powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $s
```

When the installer opens `chrome://extensions`, follow its instructions to load or reload **dsh Browser Assistant**. If dsh is already running, restart it after installation. See [Detailed installation and usage](#detailed-installation-and-usage) for prerequisites, startup commands, updates, and developer installation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The unscoped [`dsh-browser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dsh-browser) package on npm belongs to a different project and is not affiliated with this repository. This project is not currently published as an npm package; use the installer above.

## Performance

In a paired 60-run end-to-end benchmark on August 18, 2026, both backends completed all 30 assigned runs successfully, while dsh Browser Control required fewer model/tool round trips and finished faster:

| Backend | Success | Mean end-to-end latency | Mean browser tool calls |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **dsh Browser Control** | **30/30** | **5.32 s** | **3.4** |
| Matched Playwright baseline | 30/30 | 6.67 s | 4.7 |

The paired Playwright / extension duration ratio was **1.24** (95% CI **1.16–1.34**): Playwright took about 24% longer, or equivalently, dsh Browser Control reduced latency by about 20% and saved 1.35 seconds per task on average. The suite used six browser tasks, five deterministic seeds, the same DSH profile and model (`deepseek-v4-flash`), and independently validated page state. See the [benchmark methodology and reproduction guide](benchmark/README.md).

## Core capabilities

| Capability | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Read page | `browser_snapshot` | Structured text snapshot: title, URL, main text, numbered controls, and masked form fields; `delta: true` returns only changes |
| Click element | `browser_click` | Click links, buttons, checkboxes, and other controls by inventory number |
| Fill forms | `browser_type` | React/Vue-compatible input; `replace` clears the field first |
| Press keys | `browser_press` | Keyboard events such as Enter, Tab, Escape, and arrow keys |
| Scroll | `browser_scroll` | Viewport scrolling: up, down, top, and bottom |
| Navigate | `browser_navigate` / `browser_back` / `browser_forward` / `browser_reload` | Navigation inside the controlled tab, with login state preserved |
| Read region | `browser_get_text` | Lazy-loaded or partial page text |
| Wait for stability | `browser_wait` | Page-load and render-settle detection |
| Send images | `session.prompt` / `session.attachment` | Host-capability-gated image drafts, image-only prompts, and durable history previews |

## Repository layout

```
packages/browser/bridge-browser/
  cordis.patch.yml
extensions/dsh-browser/
  manifest.json          # Chrome, and the base for the others
  manifest.firefox.json  # delta
  manifest.opera.json    # delta
scripts/install.sh
scripts/install.ps1
```

## Why this design

- **Your real browser, not a headless copy**: the model works in the page you already have open, retaining logins, sessions, and cookies.
- **A text-first page interface**: numbered controls, stable IDs across snapshots, delta updates, and masked sensitive values make pages operable without screenshots; user-attached chat images use dsh's separate multimodal message path.
- **A narrow privacy boundary**: passwords and payment-card values are always rendered as `••••` and never leave the page.
- **A guarded bridge**: authenticated handshakes protect remote connections, privileged gateway methods reject non-loopback callers, and the extension binds tools to one user-controlled tab.

## Detailed installation and usage

Requirements: Node.js `^22.19` or `>=24`, Corepack/pnpm, and Chrome 116+ or Firefox 140+. Windows additionally needs Windows PowerShell 5.1, which ships with Windows, or PowerShell 7+.

### Install or update

For a managed installation, run:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lum1104/dsh-browser/refs/heads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

or, on Windows:

```powershell
$s="$env:TEMP\dsh-install.ps1"; irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lum1104/dsh-browser/refs/heads/main/scripts/install.ps1 -OutFile $s; powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $s
```

The installer downloads `main`, builds and registers the bridge plugin, builds the Chrome extension into `~/.dsh/browser-extension`, and opens `chrome://extensions`. On the first install, load that directory as an unpacked extension; on updates, click **Reload**. Restart dsh if it is already running.

`scripts/install.sh` covers macOS and Linux, and `scripts/install.ps1` covers Windows; both write the same managed workspace and the same install metadata. The installer copies the extension path to the clipboard when a clipboard tool is available (`pbcopy`, `wl-copy`, `xclip`, `xsel`, or PowerShell's `Set-Clipboard`), and prints the path either way. When no Chrome or Chromium install is found, it prints the command that installs one; set `DSH_INSTALL_BROWSER=1` to let the installer attempt that install itself.

The Windows command downloads `install.ps1` and runs it rather than piping it into `Invoke-Expression`: the script is UTF-8 with a byte order mark so Windows PowerShell renders its Chinese output, and `Invoke-Expression` rejects a leading mark.

To install the current branch from a source checkout instead:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Lum1104/dsh-browser.git
cd dsh-browser
./scripts/install.sh
```

On Windows, run `.\scripts\install.ps1` from the checkout instead. After pulling or switching revisions, rerun the installer and reload the extension.

### Firefox source build

Firefox uses an event-page background and the sidebar. Its manifest is composed at build time from `manifest.json` plus the `manifest.firefox.json` delta, so shared metadata cannot drift between targets. Build it from a checkout, then open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, choose **Load Temporary Add-on**, and select `extensions/dsh-browser/dist-firefox/manifest.json`:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm --filter dsh-browser-extension run build:firefox
```

The bridge address is still auto-discovered. Firefox's `moz-extension://` UUID does not authenticate an add-on, so copy the bearer token from `~/.dsh/ext-bridge-token` into the extension settings (the dsh startup log reports that file's path). Signed distribution can package the same `dist-firefox/` output.

### Opera source build

Opera has no Side Panel API but renders the legacy `sidebar_action` manifest key natively, so it gets its own build. Chrome reports an unrecognized-key warning for `sidebar_action` on every unpacked install, which is why the key ships only in the Opera manifest rather than in the shared one:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm --filter dsh-browser-extension run build:opera
```

Then open `opera://extensions`, enable **Developer mode**, choose **Load unpacked**, and select `extensions/dsh-browser/dist-opera/`. The panel docks as its own icon in Opera's left sidebar.

### Start and use

Start the managed installation with:

```sh
cd ~/.dsh/dsh-browser && pnpm start
```

From a source checkout, run `pnpm start` in the repository root. To use the latest public dsh release instead:

```sh
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web
```

Local Chrome use requires no configuration; Firefox requires the local bridge token described above. Open an `http://` or `https://` page, click the DeepSeek whale icon, and wait for **Connected**. Existing tabs are instrumented on the first action; protected browser pages and extension stores are not supported.

## Troubleshooting

**Side panel stays "Not connected"**

- Make sure dsh web is running locally (default `http://127.0.0.1:3080`).
- Verify the bridge is loaded: open `http://127.0.0.1:3080/ext/bridge-config`. It should return JSON such as `{"wsUrl":"ws://127.0.0.1:3080/ext/bridge"}`. If it returns a web page instead of JSON, the running dsh predates the bridge registration — restart dsh and refresh the page; the extension reconnects on its own.
- The extension probes ports 3080, 3081, 3090, and 14389 automatically. If dsh runs on another port — or you use a remote `--host 0.0.0.0` deployment — set the address (and bridge token) in the panel settings. Firefox always requires the token.

**Clicking the toolbar icon does nothing**

The extension picks its panel host at runtime: Chrome 116+ uses the native side panel, while Firefox and Opera use the sidebar they dock from the `sidebar_action` manifest key. Each target ships only the key its browser understands, so make sure you loaded the build that matches the browser (`dist/`, `dist-firefox/`, or `dist-opera/`). A browser with neither host raises a notification saying so — the panel is not opened in an ordinary window, because a `chrome-extension://` tab would compete with the page the browser tools are bound to.

## Development

The bridge plugin and Chrome/Firefox extension are both members of this repository's workspace. Run all commands from the repository root. For the first development installation, run `pnpm install`.

```sh
pnpm run build
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run test

pnpm --filter @yuxianglin/dsh-bridge-browser run build
pnpm --filter @yuxianglin/dsh-bridge-browser run typecheck
pnpm --filter @yuxianglin/dsh-bridge-browser run test

pnpm --filter dsh-browser-extension run build
pnpm --filter dsh-browser-extension run build:firefox
pnpm --filter dsh-browser-extension run test
```

Notes:

- The bridge plugin must have a built `lib/` before startup because the loader consumes it; both `scripts/install.sh` and the root `pnpm run build` build the plugin before the extension.
- The dependencies of `@deepseek-ai/dsh` and the bridge plugin are pinned to the same tested public release line. An upgrade must update the manifests and lockfile together and rerun the root checks.

## Security

- The bridge path sits outside the `/api` trust boundary and performs its own bearer-token authentication.
- Local Chrome extension origins retain zero-configuration loopback access; Firefox origins are per-install UUIDs and must present the bearer token.
- Privileged gateway methods such as `settings.*`, `credentials.*`, and `host.open*` reject non-loopback sources.
- The browser-page pipeline is text-only and never captures screenshots; explicitly attached chat images use dsh's durable attachment service. Password and payment-card values never leave the page.
- When work begins, the assistant binds to the active tab (at prompt submission, or at the first direct browser-tool call). If you switch tabs manually, later browser actions pause and the side panel asks whether the assistant should continue on the original tab or follow the new one. Choosing the original tab permits background operation; the extension never silently retargets or changes your visible tab. Closing the controlled tab also pauses tools until you explicitly select the current page.
- Page-authored text is wrapped as untrusted input. The default `auto` mode reads only the controlled tab without an extra prompt; privacy-sensitive users can select `ask` for per-read confirmation or `off` to block reads entirely. In `ask` mode, the read dialog can allow one read or persistently switch back to `auto`; this can be reversed in Settings. Read page text is sent to the selected model.
- Click, type, keypress, navigation, history, and reload calls fail closed until the user approves them. An origin may be trusted for the current side-panel session (cleared when the last panel closes or the service worker restarts), while permanent trust is managed explicitly in Settings. Explicit cross-origin `browser_navigate` calls and unknown history destinations always prompt again.
